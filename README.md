## [Project 1: Lap Time Analysis](https://github.com/boraguzel/LapTimeAnalysis)

* The aim of this project is to enhance my driving skills and achieve mastery over the combination of the Okayama International Circuit and the Toyota GR86 Cup car in iRacing. Using data analysis techniques, I analyzed and improved my driving style through my very own telemetry data obtained from the laps on the virtual racetrack. By carefully studying various aspects of my performance, such as lap times, speeds, gear shifts, throttle and brake inputs, steering wheel angles, and more, I identified areas of improvement and uncover insights that helped me optimize my racing line, braking points, and overall driving strategy. Through this data-driven approach, I made informed adjustments and refined my driving techniques, ultimately leading to faster and more consistent lap times on the challenging Okayama International Circuit.

## [Project 2: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/boraguzel/UsedCarAnalysis)

* Involved extensive Data Cleaning
* Utilized EDA techniques to reveal insights
* Trained regression models and compared their performance

## [Project 3: Bank Marketing Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/boraguzel/UsedCarAnalysis)

* In this project I worked on a bank marketing dataset containing information of several thousands of direct phone marketing, performed by a banking institution in Portugal to offer their new bank term deposit product. The original data has more than 45000 with 20 features. The one I worked on is a 20% sample of the dataset with 17 features.
* Data cleaning including handling date-time
* Data preprocessing for classification models involving utilization of One-Hot Encoding
* Constructed pipeline to compare several classification models' performance
* Interpreted on results from classification report, confusion matrix and ROC Curve
