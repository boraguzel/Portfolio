## [Project 1: Lap Time Analysis](https://github.com/boraguzel/LapTimeAnalysis)

* The aim of this project is to enhance my driving skills and achieve mastery over the combination of the Okayama International Circuit and the Toyota GR86 Cup car in iRacing. Using data analysis techniques, I analyzed and improved my driving style through my very own telemetry data obtained from the laps on the virtual racetrack. By carefully studying various aspects of my performance, such as lap times, speeds, gear shifts, throttle and brake inputs, steering wheel angles, and more, I identified areas of improvement and uncover insights that helped me optimize my racing line, braking points, and overall driving strategy. Through this data-driven approach, I made informed adjustments and refined my driving techniques, ultimately leading to faster and more consistent lap times on the challenging Okayama International Circuit.
